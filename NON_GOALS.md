# NON-GOALS

This project explicitly does **not** aim to:

* implement agentic behavior, simulated autonomy, or self-directed action
* maintain semantic, relational, or conversational memory
* infer, learn, predict, or optimize user intent over time
* perform long-horizon planning, goal formation, or strategy evolution
* adapt policies dynamically beyond explicit, external configuration
* initiate actions without external triggering or control
* replace human or upstream system authorship
* present itself as a turnkey, deploy-as-is automation product

These exclusions are **intentional design decisions**,
not missing features, deferred work, or limitations to be resolved.

They exist to preserve:

* clear authorship boundaries
* predictable execution
* auditability and debuggability
* resistance to unintended agentification
